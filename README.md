# apple_health
_Jon Stelman_
  
Experiment with interactive data visualization using bokeh.  
Uses health data exported from the Apple Health app.
Plotting is based on the NYT unemployment example provided at 
[bokeh.pydata.org/](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/unemployment.html)

Work in progress as I learn how to do more with interactive visualization using Bokeh.
